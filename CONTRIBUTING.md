# Contributing to FFX NOVA Resume Matcher

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We use Github Flow
We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use them ourselves at FFX NOVA).

## Any questions?
I'm happy to help!
